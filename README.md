Actor Model Binary Search Tree
==============================

## This project is a java implementation of binary search tree based using an actor model. 

### It implements basic operations such as:
- adding a value to the tree
- searching for a value
- removing a value

The most challenging part was to remove a value from the tree with preservation of data consistence. It required additional synchronisation to keep incomming messages order.

### What I have learned:
- basics and usages of actor model
- structure and operations of a binary search tree
- synchronisation of selected actor threads
- java queue objects

Finishing this project gave me a lot of satisfaction especially due to all of the difficulties and nuances I met implementing value removal operation.
